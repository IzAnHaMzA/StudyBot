# Project Report  

## Title  
**OS Study Bot - AI-Powered Operating Systems Learning Assistant**

## Abstract  
- **Brief overview of the project**: The OS Study Bot is a comprehensive web-based AI learning assistant specifically designed for Operating Systems course study. It combines multiple AI models (Google Gemini and local Llama) with intelligent content parsing to provide interactive Q&A, automated test evaluation, and knowledge management capabilities.
- **Problem statement**: Traditional study methods for technical subjects like Operating Systems often lack personalized feedback, immediate assessment, and efficient knowledge organization. Students need a system that can provide instant answers, evaluate their understanding, and help them track their learning progress.
- **Objectives**: To create an intelligent study assistant that can answer OS-related questions, evaluate student responses, provide detailed feedback, and maintain a searchable knowledge base of Q&A pairs with advanced page tracking and content organization.

## Introduction  
- **Background of the project**: This project emerged from the need for an intelligent tutoring system for Operating Systems courses. It leverages modern AI technologies to create an interactive learning environment that goes beyond simple question-answering to provide comprehensive educational support.
- **Importance and relevance**: In the era of AI-assisted learning, having a specialized tool for technical subjects is crucial. The OS Study Bot addresses the specific needs of computer science students studying operating systems by providing contextual, accurate, and well-structured responses based on course material.
- **Scope of the project**: The project covers the complete learning cycle from question asking to answer evaluation, including content parsing, AI integration, test management, and knowledge persistence. It supports both online (Gemini API) and offline (local Llama model) operation modes.

## Literature Review / Related Work  
- **Summary of existing work**: Traditional educational platforms like Moodle or Blackboard provide basic Q&A functionality but lack AI-powered intelligent responses. Chatbots like ChatGPT are general-purpose and may not be specifically trained on course material. Educational AI systems typically focus on specific domains but often lack the comprehensive features needed for technical subjects.
- **Comparison with proposed project**: Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, the OS Study Bot is specifically designed for Operating Systems education with features like syllabus-based content parsing, unit-wise question organization, differentiation table generation, and intelligent page tracking. It combines the best of both online and offline AI capabilities.
